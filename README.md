# Negative Review Reason Extraction Pipeline (Rule-based) + BigQuery + Looker Studio

## Overview
This project builds a minimal DataOps-style pipeline to:
1) load negative reviews(e.g.,reviews in a hotel) from CSV,
2) extract negative reasons (subject/predicate) using rule-based NLP in Python,
3) store results in BigQuery,
4) visualize KPIs and top negative reasons in Looker Studio.

**Note:** Reviews are currently in Japanese, but the pipeline is language-independent. The same approach works for English or German datasets.

## Demo / Output
- Looker Studio dashboard: <link>
- Example output table (BigQuery): `project.dataset.review_reasons`
- Screenshots: `docs/` (optional)

## Architecture
CSV → Python (cleaning + rule-based extraction + validation) → BigQuery → Looker Studio

- Ingestion inputs: a local CSV file and lexicons used to detect negative terms and categorize extracted reasons.
- Processing: Python scripts
- Storage: 3 tables + 1 view (details → [BigQuery Schema](#bigquery-schema))
- BI: Looker Studio (top reasons, trends, data quality metrics)

## Dataset
- Default source in this repo: Synthetic (dummy) reviews for a hotel (data/input/sample_thotel_reviews.csv)
  - The pipeline works with real-world reviews as well, as long as they follow the same CSV schema.

- Language: Japanese (current rules are optimized for Japanese text)
### Expected CSV schema
Columns expected in the input CSV:

- source_id (Review ID in the original source. Type: STRING or INT64)
- source (Review source name. Type: STRING; e.g., booking.com, tripadvisor)
- review_text (Review text to analyze. Type: STRING)
- posted_at (When the review was posted. Type: DATE or TIMESTAMP) (optional)
- user_name (Reviewer name. Type: STRING) (optional)


## Extraction Logic (Rule-based)
Goal: extract word-pairs like **(subject, predicate)** from a negative review.

Current rule examples: First, we detect negative terms in each review using the negative lexicon, then extract the paired subject and/or predicate from the same sentence using the rules below:
- When the negative term is a noun: Extract the verb, adjective, or adjectival noun immediately following it within the same sentence as the predicate.
- When the negative term is a verb/adjective/adjectival noun: Extract the noun closest to the negative word appearing earlier in the same sentence as the subject.

[Other rules are here](docs/extraction_rules.md)

<br/>

Output fields:
- `reason_subject` (e.g., “ベッド(Bed)”, “スタッフ(Staff)”, “風呂(Bathroom)”. The subject can be multiple terms)
- `reason_predicate` (e.g., “汚い(dirty)”, “うるさい(noisy)”, “不愛想(unfriendly)”)


Limitations:
- Cannot extract(detect) reasons from 'contextually negative texts' that don’t contain any negative words. (e.g., "隣の部屋から音が聞こえました"("I heard people talking in the next room."))
- Multiple reason pairs can be extracted from one review, but they may not represent different problems: they might describe the same issue using different wording (e.g., S1: Linen / P1: Dirty , S2: Towel / P2: Unpleasant).
- The extracted subject may include multiple tokens and some unnecessary words, since it is difficult to isolate a single subject with the current word-level logic. (e.g., S:['東京'(Tokyo),'ホテル'(hotel),'リネン'(linen)], P:'汚い(dirty)'). To imporove this, we may need deeper analysis as semantic parsing.


## Categorizing logic
Goal: categorize the extracted reasons into **Entity** and **Issue** using the customizable lexicons. 

**Entity:** subject(s) are expected to be matched to one entity which defined in entity_lexicon.csv
e.g., 'リネン'(linen) → Bedding. '自販機'(vending machine) → Facilities

| term   | language | entity     | version |
|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| リネン | ja       | Bedding    | 1       |
| 自販機 | ja       | Facilities | 1       |
| ・・・ | 
Excerpt: entity_lexicon.csv


**Issue:** predicate is expected to be matched to one issue-category which defined in issue_lexicon.csv
e.g., '聞こえる(hear)'→'Noise', '不安(worried)'→'Safety'
| term   | language | issue_category | sentiment | version |
|--------|----------|------------|-----|---------|
| 聞こえる | ja       | Noise    | negative | 1       |
| 不安 | ja       | Safety | negative | 1       |
| ・・・ | 
Excerpt: issue_lexicon.csv

Note: The 'sentiment' column could be set to 'positive' when extracting positive reasons instead of negative ones (currently not implemented).


## Data Quality Checks
Implemented minimal checks for raw reveiws before loading to BigQuery:
- required column presence(`source_id`, `source`, `review_text`, and `posted_at`). `posted_at` can be checked as optional.
- duplicate `reviews` detection: check whether `source_id` and `source` are the same. if so, we consider them to be the duplicated reviews.
- invalid timestamp format handling(`posted_at` and `posted_at_iso`. (`posted_at_iso` will be added as metadata for loading into BigQuery after ingestion.))
- basic length filter to `review_text` (between 5 and 500 characters).

<br/>

Note: Records that do not pass the quality check are flagged as `is_valid = False` and excluded from downstream processing. They can be monitored in the review_validated table.
<br/>


## BigQuery Schema
**review_raw:** raw ingest

**review_validated:** validated reviews + metadata (append-only)

**review_validated_dedup (VIEW):** latest/representative row per review_id

**review_reasons:** extracted reasons

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- A Google Cloud project with a BigQuery dataset

### Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Environment Variables
Copy .env.example to .env, then configure the following variables:

`UUID_STRING` – Used to generate a consistent reason_id for identical review texts across different pipeline runs.
Generate one by running:

bash
```
uuidgen
```

`PROJECT_ID` – Your BigQuery project ID.

`DATASET_ID` – Your BigQuery dataset ID.

`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` – Path to your Google Cloud service account key JSON file (set either in your system environment or in .env).


⚠️ Do not commit your service account key file to the repository.

### Run

Place the file you want to analyze in `data/input/`, then run the command below.

(For the required file schema, see [here](#expected-csv-schema)).
```
python -m src.reason_extraction.main \
  --input-file data/input/(your filename).csv  \
  --output bigquery
```

To output the analysis results to `data/output/` instead of BigQuery, run:
```
python -m src.reason_extraction.main \
  --input-file data/input/(your filename).csv  \
  --output local
```

### How to create BigQuery Views
After running main.py, run the command below:
```
python -m src.reason_extraction.apply_sql
```
